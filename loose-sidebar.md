# i'm thinking of loosing the sidebar

i saw https://chrisgregori.dev on mobile and i like it better than my thing. it still has all the stats, but it doesn't take up that much space.

my original plan was to use the sidebar for tools in my apps, but [cert](/cert) only has the export button and it's not even on the sidebar, and when i get back to [sld](/sld) i can make an excalidraw-style taskbar or do something like

![map-successor.dark.svg](/map-successor.dark.svg)

aside from the stats i currently have i'll need to add the tags since they exist in the system anyway
