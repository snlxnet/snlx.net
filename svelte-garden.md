#fleeting 

# maybe switch to sveltekit or astro for snlx.net

## what's the problem now
- firefox doesn't prefetch the pages
- mobile firefox doesn't support view transitions
- i may want to reuse components across different projects
- the secret notes and the public notes are rendered using different markdown processors

## what will get worse after the switch
- the site will require more tools to build

## astro or sveltekit
TODO
