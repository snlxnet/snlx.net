## Now
I'm working on this site, see [mk-api](/mk-api). TLDR:
- publishing is now as simple pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` in Obsidian ([why-obsi](/why-obsi))
- secret notes (for work & uni) are now implemented
- working on making the backlinks visible. The [test site](https://github.com/snlxnet/bridge-sandbox/) works, but I'm not yet quite ready to bring that here (see [mk-bridge](/mk-bridge))
- I want to add a pomodoro timer to my Obsidian system that is mirrored on the site

## Planned
[trk](/trk)

## Past Projects
- [cert](/cert), a certificate generator for a math competition @ the uni (devlog: [cert-site-start](/cert-site-start)), I'll return to it later in 2026 ([revive-cert](/revive-cert))
